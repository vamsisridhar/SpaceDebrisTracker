                Out of the 5,000 satellites in Earth’s orbit, 3,000 of them are dead. How do you dispose of dead satellites? You don’t. Or at least that’s what has been happening until now. Not only this, but as rockets and satellites zoom into space, they loose vast quantities of dust and paint flecks that might seem harmless, but are actually disastrous when they form debris clouds whizzing around the Earth at high speeds. Think of all the money invested in building satellites and space-craft, and how ridiculous it seems for that to be destroyed in a matter of milliseconds through a collision with space junk. We are not in a sustainable situation and something must be done.

                <br><br>This just is the cause of large sums of money being put into hundreds collision avoidance manouvres, but what’s the alternative? There are people in the International Space Station, and this trash could be the death of them. There is much talk about greenifying our planet, but our planet is not only what lies on the surface of the Earth, our planet is also inextricably linked to all the things that orbit around it, so that space needs to be cleaned up to. We can’t ignore the mess just because of the distance, especially when it can cost lives.

                <br><br>As the internet grows and companies plan to launch even more satellites into the sky, this  becomes of even higher importance. Kessler syndrome is a theory that states that if too much stuff is in orbit, a chain reaction of collisions will result in Earth’s orbit becoming unusable.

                <br><br>But how to we combat this space debris? There is potential. Ideas include space nets, firing dust to send debris into lower orbits (to eventually flame up), firing at it from Earth with a laser or the EPFL CleanMe project. 

                <br><br>Whatever the method, the first step is to raise awareness. That is the purpose of this website. By visualising the enormous quantity of debris surrounding the Earth in real-time, we hope to inspire current and future generations to work towards resolving this. To the scientists, we need to work out more technologies for the spatial clean-up. To the activists, we need the political support and movement of the masses to be direct some more attention to the skies. And to the investors, we need you to think ethically about what you put your money into and whether this is harming our planet as well as your pockets.
